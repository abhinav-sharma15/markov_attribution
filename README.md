# markov_attribution

Studying attribution outcomes from pre-engineered cross channel data.
In this instance, we intentianally lowered last touch impact of a perticular channel (in this case 'Instagram'). The channel had reduced last touch impact but considerable midlle funnel imapct. 'Online Display' had simialr properties but to limited scale.
The results highlight that only data-led attribution models (in this case markov chain) can bring to light importance of such channels to marketers view.
